This repository contains a Python code example demonstrating a common recursion error that leads to stack overflow. The bug.py file shows the problematic recursive function. The bugSolution.py file provides a corrected version of the function that handles both positive and negative x values. The solution ensures that the function terminates correctly, preventing stack overflow exceptions.
